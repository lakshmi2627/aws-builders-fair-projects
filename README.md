# AWS Builder's Fair Project Sample Code

The aws-builders-fair-projects repo contains sample code and infrastructure template projects from AWS Builder's Fair events. The project sample code is intended to help you replicate what you may have seen in a Builder's Fair project demo at an event, and to set up AWS infrastructure for further experimentation.

## Prerequisites

For most projects you will require an AWS account. If you haven't already done so you first need to:
- [Create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/how-to-get-started-on-aws-from-a-dead-standstill/).
- Make sure you're signed into AWS as an [IAM user with admin access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html). Don't use the root account!
- [Create an EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair). This may be necessary to access any bastion host or EC2 instances.
- [Clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) so that you have a local copy of the templates.
